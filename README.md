- Ideal for tech retail; add database for live use.

FIXES NEEDED 
- The search box is not functional on other pages but it is fully functional on the home page
- The account creatiion verification and login work very well but the face verification needs a database to save userdata.
- The billing section does not have an bank account tied to it. 
- ELVCOMPUTECH is my company name. PLEASE NOTE u have to change all occurances of ELVCOMPUTECH on all pages to ur own NAME BEFORE USING IT.
